  "aboutText1": "Welcome to Network 24. This simulation chamber is the last remaining interface to 'The Billionaire Engine.' The system, designed to test the boundaries of human knowledge and greed, was abandoned decades ago, yet its core still powers this challenge. You are one of the few who have managed to reconnect with the active node.",
  "aboutText2": "The system is ancient. Extremely ancient. Our developers have identified that its age has spawned 'personalities' within the code, which we call mini-games and hidden features. These are not bugs—they are Feature Documentation from a bygone era. They reward (or punish) those who dare to explore beyond the standard questions.",
  "aboutText3": "This current interface, built using Vue.js and Socket.IO, is our attempt to stabilize the Engine. If you encounter an unexpected crash, a flawed question, or a glowing screen, please report it! You are helping us tame the machine. (But remember, we still aren't paying out real cash prizes... yet.)",

  "faqA1": "The Engine measures your response time. The faster you confirm the truth, the larger the portion of the reserve allocated to your account.",
  "faqQ2": ">> IDENTITY: Why am I designated as an 'Operator'?",
  "faqA2": "You are a link in the chain. As an operator, you interact directly with the logic layer to stabilize unstable data fields.",
  "faqQ3": ">> ERROR_CODE: What happens during incorrect data entry?",
  "faqA3": "The system regards errors as corrupt code. No points are awarded, and your authority level within the network stagnates.",
  "faqQ4": ">> HISTORY: Who built 'The Billionaire Engine'?",
  "faqA4": "The origin is unknown. Some logs point to anonymous architects; others claim it emerged spontaneously from network noise.",
